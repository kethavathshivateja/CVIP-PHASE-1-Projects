Task:1 Normal Task: Analyze customer behavior based on transaction data

Develop a data analysis project that focuses on understanding and analyzing
customer behavior based on transactional data. The goal is to perform Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights into customer preferences,
purchasing patterns, and overall behavior.

# Customer Behavior Analysis at CodersCave

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted at CodersCave, focusing on analyzing customer behavior through transactional data. The project aims to derive deep insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior to inform better business decisions and enhance customer engagement strategies.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Cleaning**: Implemented advanced data preparation techniques to ensure the integrity and quality of analysis inputs.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Used a variety of data visualization tools to clearly depict customer purchasing patterns and preferences.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Developed models to predict future customer behaviors, enabling the formulation of targeted marketing strategies.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (for predictive modeling)

# Golden Task: Choose a dataset with a time component and perform time series analysis

Embark on a time series analysis project using a dataset with a time
component, specifically historical stock prices. The objective is to uncover
patterns, trends, and insights from the temporal data, enabling a better
understanding of stock price movements over time.

# Time Series Analysis of Historical Stock Prices

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical stock prices to uncover trends, patterns, and potential forecast opportunities using time series analysis techniques. The analysis is conducted on stocks like Amazon, Netflix, and Bitcoin to understand their market behavior over time.

## Key Highlights
- Time Series Decomposition to identify trends and seasonal patterns.
- Autocorrelation Analysis to explore the data dependencies.
- ARIMA Modeling for predicting future stock prices.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
